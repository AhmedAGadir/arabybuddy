/**
 * XState State Machines
 * 
 * State machines for managing complex stateful logic:
 * - Character animation states
 * - Lesson flow control
 * - Game state management
 * 
 * XState provides:
 * - Predictable state transitions
 * - Visual state charts
 * - Type-safe state management
 * - Better debugging and testing
 * 
 * Example machines to be implemented:
 * - character-animation-machine.ts - Controls character animation states (idle, speaking, listening, etc.)
 * - lesson-flow-machine.ts - Manages lesson progression through chat steps
 * - recording-machine.ts - Handles microphone recording states
